# Game Jam 2018

## Introduction

This game was developed by me and Servando Diaz for the 2018 Game Jam. The game is called Kitty Killer Murder Spree. The theme of the game jam was transmission. The game is only playable with 2 players.

## Gameplay and mechanics

The players take control of two Roomba-like vacuum robots that are equipped with vaporizing lasers. The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible while trying to defend yourself against the incoming barrage of angry kittens. The two players have to work together to achieve this. Each player has a different role:

- Charger: The charger must charge himself on the charging station located in the center of the screen. He can then transmit his energy to the defender.
- Defender: The defender can use the energy he received from the charger to vaporize the cats.
